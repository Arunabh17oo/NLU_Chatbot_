# Workspace Persistence Test Guide

## What has been implemented:

### Backend Changes:
1. **GET /api/training/workspaces** - Fetches all workspaces for the current user
2. **POST /api/training/workspace** - Creates a new workspace (with duplicate name checking)
3. **DELETE /api/training/workspace/:workspaceId** - Deletes a workspace and all associated data

### Frontend Changes:
1. **loadWorkspaces()** - Function to fetch and display user's workspaces
2. **Enhanced workspace display** - Shows status, accuracy, and creation date
3. **Improved delete functionality** - Uses new API endpoint and refreshes list
4. **Auto-load on login** - Workspaces are loaded when user enters workspace page

## How to test:

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   # Backend (Terminal 1)
   cd chatbot-backend && npm start
   
   # Frontend (Terminal 2) 
   cd chatbot-frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test workspace persistence:**
   - Login to the application
   - Create a new workspace
   - Logout and login again
   - Verify the workspace is still there
   - Create another workspace
   - Delete one workspace
   - Verify only the remaining workspace is shown

3. **Test workspace features:**
   - Workspace status indicators (Draft, Training, Trained, Deployed, Archived)
   - Accuracy display (when available)
   - Creation date display
   - Proper error handling for duplicate names
   - Confirmation dialog for deletion

## Expected behavior:

✅ **Workspaces persist across sessions** - Created workspaces are saved and loaded on login
✅ **Duplicate name prevention** - Cannot create workspaces with the same name
✅ **Complete deletion** - Deleting a workspace removes all associated data
✅ **Real-time updates** - Workspace list refreshes after create/delete operations
✅ **Enhanced UI** - Better visual indicators for workspace status and performance
✅ **Error handling** - Proper error messages for failed operations

## Database structure:

Workspaces are stored as Projects in MongoDB with:
- `workspaceId`: Unique identifier for the workspace
- `name`: Workspace name
- `description`: Workspace description
- `ownerId`: User who owns the workspace
- `status`: Current status (draft, training, trained, deployed, archived)
- `performance`: Model performance metrics
- `createdAt`: Creation timestamp
- `isActive`: Whether the workspace is active

The system now provides complete workspace management with persistence across user sessions.
